# Mobile Price Classification

Mobile Price Classification categorizes or classifies different mobile into similar price categories by finding relations between features of a mobile phone (E.g.: - RAM, Internal Memory etc).

This idea of this project is based on a mobile website that helps you find your phone based on your budget. However, with this project I am to categorise the mobile phones in sub categories of “Budget”, “Mid-Range”, “Premium” and “Ultra-Premium” price segment.

In this project I have used 3 different models to classify the price and then used the most accurate model for the final prediction.

The data for training and testing has been taken from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/iabhishekofficial/mobile-price-classification).

The model takes a set of 20 parameters then according to those parameters it predicts the in which category should the mobile price fall, 0 being budget and 3 being ultrapremium.
